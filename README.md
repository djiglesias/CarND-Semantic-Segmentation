# CarND Semantic Segmentation

## Overview

The goal of this project was to split up an automotive video into individual camera frames and paint each pixel of each frame using a Fully Convolusional Network (FCN). Each pixel is classified as either 'road' or 'not road' to help other systems in the car to determine where the space is. Following the [walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1486&v=5g9sZIwGubk) and [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/989/view) for this project, the goal is to become familiar with how to apply segmantic segmenation to a real world application.

Follow the [installation guide](https://github.com/djiglesias/CarND-Semantic-Segmentation/blob/master/INSTALL.md) for installing the required system dependencies, and download the [labelled data set](http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip) for training the model. To begin training your model just open a terminal, navigate to this project folder, and run `python3 main.py`.
